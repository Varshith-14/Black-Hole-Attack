# Black-Hole-Attack
A Wireless sensor network is a network of devices that can communicate the information 
gathered from a monitored field through wireless links. The data is forwarded through multiple 
nodes, and with a gateway, the data is connected to other networks like wireless Ethernet. There 
are different types of attacks against wireless sensor networks. Black hole is one of the possible 
attacks in wireless sensor networks.  
These networks are used to monitor physical or environmental conditions like sound, pressure, 
temperature, and co-operatively pass data through the network to the main location.  
A mobile ad hoc network MANET is a collection of mobile nodes in which the nodes can 
communicate without the need of any access point. The mobile hosts are free to move 
dynamically and act as routers. Security is a highly challenging issue in ad hoc networks. The 
presence of malicious nodes will affect the performance and reliability of the network. 
The routing protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern the movement of data within 
the network. In black hole attack, a malicious node uses its routing protocol to publicize itself for 
having the shortest route to the destination node.
